# Malware Analysis Report – SHA-1: 227c0a54d2cc0f984eed50a3738267077a626432

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed forensic analysis of a ransomware sample that encrypted a user's personal files. The malware used a hardcoded AES-CBC encryption scheme with fixed key and IV values. Through combined static and dynamic analysis, we successfully reverse engineered the binary, extracted the cryptographic parameters, and developed a decryption tool to recover the affected data.

**⚠️ WARNING: The malware sample is included for educational and research purposes only. Do _NOT_ run the binary on your host machine. Use a sandboxed or virtual environment to avoid infecting your system.**

## Report Contents

- **PDF Report:** A full breakdown of the ransomware's functionality, including disassembly, memory analysis, runtime behavior, and key extraction.
- **Decryption Script:** A Python tool (`decryptScript.py`) to decrypt files affected by this specific ransomware strain.
- **Malware Sample:** The original binary file used for analysis (**handle with extreme caution**).

---

## Key Findings

- The malware encrypts files in its working directory using **AES-128 in CBC mode**.
- It embeds a **hardcoded 128-bit key and IV** within the binary.
- Encrypted files have a specific structure: a 16-byte IV, a 4-byte chunk length, followed by the AES-encrypted data.
- After encryption, the malware self-deletes using a command-line routine involving `ping` and `del`.

## Using the Decryption Tool

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pycryptodome
   ```
2. Place decryptScript.py in the same directory as the encrypted files.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python decryptScript.py
   ```
